#Chp 1 of DOET
I think this chapter was very interesting with its methodology of how things are hard to use especially when they suppose to be easier to use. This can make things more complicated which I thought was just profoundly interesting. I think I really struggle to understand the signifiers and other more technical aspects of the tech, but I agree that designers should learn more psychology and learn more about humans and how they operate, think, and make mistakes. This will make designers design better and come up with more human compatible designs that actually make sense and people don't struggle to use. I also sympathize with his door struggle as there are often things that aren't exactly clear or spelled out in every design. I think I liked his talks with the world renowned psychologist. It was funny to hear about him turning off his hearing aids at points and also how hard things were to operate to normal people who didn't have a design mind set. Overall, this chapter was a good introduction to the psychology of development and how we as designers should learn to think about people using products more. The more human minded we are when it comes to designing the better our design will be.
