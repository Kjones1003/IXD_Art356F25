In the current chapter (three) it talks about the concept of the mind with transactive memory. It gives way to the topic on procedural Knowledge and declarative knowledge. 
Using this the brain uses logic and facts to try and justifiy different parts of life. I think i like the concept of declartive and procedural memory as it really make 
the human mind make sense. I also think making simple conceptual models is the way to make sure I learn so I can agree with this chapter a lot. Overall I think the message for this chapter
and the lessons to make a simple design for people to understand is doable and helped my designing mind.
