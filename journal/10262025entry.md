In chapter four of the book we learned about constraints, discoverability, and more on signifiers. The different contrstaints help people who we design for to take 
the right action per the specific constraint. There are many different kinds of constraints: physial, cultural, semantic, and logical. The right design uses the right constraint for users to know what action they should take when using a product. This is how you know it has a good design. Discoverability means users are able to figure out what they can do while using the product. This is only possible with signifiers. Signifiers are signs which show how and where to act. I believe this chapter was meant to help us become better designers by helping us communicate how to make users lives easier when knowing what to do with a product.
