This chapter is all abotu Human error and specifically Don goes into two different types. Don goes into types about slips and mistakes. Slips are when users try to do something with a goal in mind but execute the wrong action
This makes it hard for Users to complete that goal or even understand where they are after that action excutes incorrectly. This occurs when the mapping of a site isn't right and it leds to users doing wrong actions. 
The other kind of error that a user makes that Don goes over is a mistake. A mistake is when users interpet things in the wrong way due to bad design chices such as msileading the user with confusing and wrong info, 
confusing interfaces, and bad conceptual models. These are both usually due to bad design. This leads us to where Don asks us to create strategies to fix errors before they even enter models. He asks us designers to use clear 
info and constraints as well as a whole host of other strategies to employ to try and correct erros before the models even get to users. This is the important parts of chapter 5 which leads us to prevent errors and
guide users to be able to complete their goals without messing up.
